            It’s incredible to think that just a few days ago, I didn’t even know you existed. Meeting you at college was the kind of unexpected twist I’ll always be grateful for. At first, I wasn’t sure how we’d connect, what we’d talk about, or what you’d be like. But now, after just a short time of knowing you, I’ve come to realize something—you’re absolutely amazing, and I can’t help but feel lucky to have met you.
